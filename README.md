# Adblock List for Twitter

Elon "Chief Nitwit" Musk decided anyone can purchase the verified badge. Fortunately, what was once a sign of legitimacy is now a verified troll indicator. 

**uBlock Origin to the rescue!**

This list makes Twitter 50% less shitty and removes the following:
* Twitter Blue subscription menu item
* Twitter Blue subscription settings menu item
* Verified user tweets (including the village idiot himself)

** This adblock list does not impact company (gold checkmark) or government entities (grey checkmark).

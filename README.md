# Anti-Verification List for Twitter

Elon "Chief Nitwit" Musk decided anyone can purchase the verified badge. Fortunately, what was once a sign of legitimacy is now a verified troll indicator. 

**uBlock Origin to the rescue!**

This list makes Twitter 50% less shitty and removes the following:
* Twitter Blue subscription menu item
* Twitter Blue subscription settings menu item
* Verified user tweets (including the village idiot himself)

** This adblock list does not impact company (gold checkmark) or government entities (grey checkmark).

Like the sore loser he is, it seems Salty Nut Elon became offended at the #BlockTheBlue movement and started [adding back verified badges](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/23/verified-checkmark-twitter-badge) to unpaying and dead Twitter users. üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Therefore, I believe the most effective solution for #BlockTheBlue would be to create a FOSS list of community-verified users and bundle it into an extension for Chrome and Firefox, which will be the future of this project.

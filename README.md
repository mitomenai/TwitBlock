# Adblock List for Twitter

Elon Musk decided anyone can purchase the verified badge. Fortunately, what was once a sign of legitimacy is now a verified troll indicator. 

uBlock Origin to the rescue!

This list removes the following:
* Twitter Blue subscription menu item
* Twitter Blue subscription settings menu item
* Verified user tweets (including Chief Nitwit himself)

** This adblock list does not impact company (gold checkmark) or government entities (grey checkmark).
